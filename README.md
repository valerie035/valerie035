## Hi 👋 I'm Valerie

Where insight meets impact: educator, analyst, and systems thinker with a musician’s ear for nuance.

powerhouse blend of clarity and complexity — an educator, musician, data sleuth, and boundary ninja rolled into one. I chase justice with calm conviction, wield words like a scalpel, and balance high-stakes parenting with heart and humor. I'm the type who builds scaffolding while walking the tightrope, learning SQL by sunrise and composing literal or figurative melodies by sunset. Always evolving, always intentional — a layered life in motion.



🎶 I'm a musician and educator who found a deep love for data, tech, and the power they hold to make meaningful change.

I’m especially passionate about:
- 🌍 Equity, opportunity, and access through education, tech, and innovation with all perspectives at the table
- 🎓 Making data + learning approachable and empowering  
- 🧠 Blending creativity and analysis—music and code live side by side in my world
